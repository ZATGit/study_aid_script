# Class and Function Study Aid
A script to help new programmers interpret class objects & instances and their interactions with other classes & functions.  

## How to use it

The program works similarly to flashcards. When the prompt has been generated, describe what you see in english. Users can also flip the question:answer order of the question dictionary to answer:question so that the prompt provides an english description that must answered with Python code. The program pulls the word bank from a web page but in the future will allow for a local word bank as well.

## Prerequisites

pip
